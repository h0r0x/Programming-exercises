# Problem

>You are given an integer `n`, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

- If the current number of teams is **even**, each team gets paired with another team. A total of `n / 2` matches are played, and `n / 2` teams advance to the next round.
- If the current number of teams is **odd**, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of `(n - 1) / 2` matches are played, and `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams advance to the next round.

>Return _the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided._



### Examples

---
**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7
**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

```
Details of the tournament: 
- 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.

Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
```


---
**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 14
**Output:** 13

**Explanation:**

```
Details of the tournament:
- 1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, and 7 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.

Total number of matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
```


# Code

### Simulation

```python
def numberOfMatches(n):
	ans = 0
	while n > 1:
		if n % 2 == 0:
			n = n // 2
			ans += n
		else:
			n = (n - 1) // 2
			ans += n
			n += 1

	return ans
```

The idea is to simulate the tournament --> the problem description describes what happens at each round:

- If `n` is even, `n / 2` matches are played and `n / 2` teams play next round.
- If `n` is odd, `(n - 1) / 2` matches are played and `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams play next round.

We can simply simulate the tournament according to the rules. We create a while loop that runs until `n = 1`.

### Using Logic

```python
def numberOfMatches(n):
   return n - 1
```

The idea is: 
- There are `n` teams participating in the tournament.  
- After each match `1` team is eliminated.  
- `n-1` teams needs to be eliminated: hence `n-1` matches.
