You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is **good** if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return _the sum of lengths of all good strings in words_.

## Examples

---
**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = `["cat","bt","hat","tree"]`, chars = "atach"
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

---
**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = `["hello","world","leetcode"]`, chars = "welldonehoneyr"
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.

# Code

```python
def countCharacters(words,chars):
	dic = {}
	for c in chars:
		dic[c] = dic.get(c, 0) + 1

	print("Il dizionario dei chars è:\n",dic,"\n")

	counter = 0

	for w in words:
		dic_copy = dict(dic)
		stop = False
		for c in w:
			if c in dic_copy and dic_copy[c] > 0:
				dic_copy[c] -= 1
			else:
				stop = True
				break



		if stop == False:
			counter += len(w)

		print(f"Dizionario risultante per la parola \"{w}\" è: \n",dic_copy)
		print(" Counter = ",counter, "\n")

	return counter
```

The idea is to build a dictionary containing the occurrences of the char in the input string `chars`; this is done using the following lines of code:

```python
	dic = {}
	for c in chars:
		dic[c] = dic.get(c, 0) + 1
```

Next, each word in words is analysed by comparing the char present in it with those present in the dictionary:
- if the analysed char **is not** present in the dictionary then word analysis is stopped and the counter is not incremented;

	``` python
	if c in dic_copy:
		...
	else:
		stop = True
		break
```

- if the analysed char is present in the dictionary and its value is > 0 then decrements the value within the dictionary by one;

``` python
	if c in dic_copy and dic_copy[c] > 0:
		dic_copy[c] -= 1
```

- if the analysed char is present in the dictionary and its value is == 0 then it means that the analysed word has more occurrences for the char than we can use (the input chars); 

	``` python
	if dic_copy[c] > 0:
		...
	else:
		stop = True
		break
```

## Example 

``` Text
Il dizionario dei chars è:
 {'a': 2, 't': 1, 'c': 1, 'h': 1} 

Dizionario risultante per la parola "cat" è: 
 {'a': 1, 't': 0, 'c': 0, 'h': 1}
 Counter =  3 

Dizionario risultante per la parola "bt" è: 
 {'a': 2, 't': 1, 'c': 1, 'h': 1}
 Counter =  3 

Dizionario risultante per la parola "hat" è: 
 {'a': 1, 't': 0, 'c': 1, 'h': 0}
 Counter =  6 

Dizionario risultante per la parola "tree" è: 
 {'a': 2, 't': 0, 'c': 1, 'h': 1}
 Counter =  6 
```

Note how in the case where:
- the word is "bt" execution is interrupted when it is evaluated in char "b": in fact, le dictionary is not present
- the word is "tree" execution is aborted when it is evaluated in char "r": in fact, le dictionary is not present
