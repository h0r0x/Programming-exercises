# Problem

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer. An integer is **good** if it meets the following conditions:

- It is a **substring** of `num` with length `3`.
- It consists of only one unique digit.

> Return _the **maximum good** integer as a **string** or an empty string_ `""` _if no such integer exists_.

Note:

- A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
- There may be **leading zeroes** in `num` or a good integer.


### Examples

--- 
**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = "6**777**133339"
**Output:** "777"

>*Explanation:** There are two distinct good integers: "777" and "333".
  "777" is the largest, so we return "777".

--- 
**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = "23**000**19"
**Output:** "000"

>**Explanation:** "000" is the only good integer.

--- 
**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = "42352338"
**Output:** ""

>**Explanation:** No substring of length 3 consists of only one unique digit. Therefore, there are no good integers.

# Code


```python

def largestGoodInteger(num):
    # Initialize a variable to store the maximum digit found
    max_n = -1

    # Iterate through the characters of the input string, excluding the first and last  characters
    for i in range(1, len(num)-1):
        # Check if the current digit is equal to its adjacent digits
        if num[i-1] == num[i] and num[i] == num[i+1]:
            # Update max_n if the current digit is greater
            max_n = max(max_n, int(num[i]))

    # If a consecutive digit is found, return a string with that digit repeated three times
    if max_n != -1:
        s = str(max_n)
        return s * 3
    else:
        # If no consecutive digit is found, return an empty string
        return ""


```


The Idea:
- The function scrolls the string num and looks at each digit by comparing it with the surrounding digits. If it finds a digit that is equal to both the previous and the next digit, it checks whether this digit is greater than the maximum number found so far (`max_n`). If so, it updates `max_n` with the value of this digit.
- Finally, if `max_n` is different from `-1` (i.e. if it has found a number that repeats three times consecutively), it returns a string containing that number repeated three times. Otherwise, it returns an `empty string`.
